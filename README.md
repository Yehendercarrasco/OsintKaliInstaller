# Bash script for OSINTk.o tools 

OSINTkoSCR is a streamlined installation script designed for setting up a customized OSINT toolkit on Kali Linux. The script installs a curated selection of OSINT tools, ranging from username lookups to social media analysis, and creates menu entries for quick access. 

While OSINTkoSCR was initially designed for the OSINTko Kali ISO, it is flexible and can be modified to work on other Linux distributions. Some adjustments to paths or dependencies may be required based on the environment.

## Notes

- Desktop Directories: For the .desktop entries to work effectively, ensure you have a desktop-directories structure created. This is typically pre-configured in environments like XFCE but may require additional setup on others.

- Customization: OSINTkoSCR is a flexible, universal script that can be modified to add additional tools by including them in the scriptâ€™s tool arrays. Users are encouraged to add their own OSINT tools and categories as desired.
